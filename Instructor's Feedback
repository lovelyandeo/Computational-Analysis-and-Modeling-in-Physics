SPECIFIC FEEDBACK:
I appreciate putting emphasis on key insights by changing the font color, 
but I suggest making the text BOLD as well, 
or use a highlight tool so as to make it very readable. 
For plot presentaton, x/yticks can be removed since they only show the image dimension. 
Also, acknowledge your classmates if ever they provided help or insights, 
those whom you collaborated with (if there's any). 

GENERAL FEEDBACK:
The applications, especially on satellite imagery, is very close to home. 
In fact, segemntation can be improved if you perform it per color channel (in RGB), 
and high level segmentation can be attained using multi-spectral and hyper-spectral data (10-100+ channels, instead of 3). 
This is how early land use classification models were implemented. 
Overall, you have very pleasing reports and it felt like I was with you as I read them, as it should be. 
I really like the "take-away" tidbits on some slides. 
Job well done, Lovely. The future is bright with you. Let's show the world that Physics is fun!
